Writer's Block is:

  - a personal wiki engine for hackers
  - simplistic opinionated markdown processor with Zettelkasten flavor
  - minimalistic static site generator

It provides automatic indexing of directories with markdown documents,
images and static files.

Documents can be linked together using `[[Wikilinks]]` and backlinks are tracked.
