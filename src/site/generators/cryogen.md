description: A simple static site generator shipped on Leiningen
---

Cryogen is a simple static site generator built with Clojure.
It's shipped on Leiningen so setup is fuss free and there's no
need to mess with databases or other CMS systems.

Cryogen reads through a directory containing your Markdown content,
compiles it into HTML and injects the content into your templates
with the [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/selmer) templating system.
It then spits out a ready-to-publish website complete with a sitemap and RSS feed.

### Features

- Blog posts and pages with Markdown
- Tags
- Table of contents generation
- Default Twitter Bootstrap theme
- Plain HTML page templates
- Code syntax highlighting
- Disqus support
- GitHub Gist integration
- Sitemap
- Sass/SCSS compilation
- RSS
