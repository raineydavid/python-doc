description: SvelteKit is an application framework powered by Svelte â€” build bigger apps with a smaller footprint.
---

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing. [Read the guide](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) or the [introductory blog post](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit) to learn more.

All the SEO and progressive enhancement of a server-rendered app, with the slick navigation of an SPA.

It's the successor to Sapper. It's like Next.js and Nuxt.js, but faster and smaller because it's powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
