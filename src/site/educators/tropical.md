Tropical is a modern static site generator without complex magic.

It's just [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) plus a layer of **familiar, industry-standard tools & conventions** (like React, Storybook, MDX & Fela) for building *fast*, mostly-just-HTML websites with [islands](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) of targeted client-side JS.

It's also **just a [template repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)**. There's no library to install or configure. You're not stuck with these features. If [Vite can do it](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html), so can your Tropical site.
