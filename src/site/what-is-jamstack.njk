  <h1>What is Jamstack?</h1>
  <p>
    Jamstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The core principles of <a href="/glossary/pre-render">pre-rendering</a>, and <a href="/glossary/decoupling">decoupling</a>, enable sites and applications to be delivered with greater confidence and reslience than ever before.

  <h2>Pre-rendering</h2>
  <p>
    With Jamstack, the entire front end is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets during a build process. This process of pre-rending results in sites which can be served directly from a <a href="/glossary/cdn">CDN</a>, reducing the cost, complexity and risk, of dynamic servers as cirticial infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    With so many popular tools for generating sites</a>, like Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy, NextJS, <a href="/generators">and very many more</a>, most web developers are already familiar with the tools needed to become productive Jamstack developers.

  <h2>Enhancing with JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
    With the <a href="/glossary/markup">markup</a> and other user interface assets of Jamstack sites served directly from a CDN, they can be delivered very quickly and securely. On this foundation, Jamstack sites can use JavaScript and APIs to talk to backend services, allowing experiences to be enhanced and personalized.

  <h2>Named to help the conversation</h2>
  <p>
    The name "Jamstack" came about because as Matt Biilmann and Chris Bach were creating modern web development workflows and capabilities at Netlify, they found there was no easy way to refer to the architectural approach in conversation. Jamstack embraces many existing fundamentals of web architectures, and so they created the term Jamstack to help us talk about it more succinctly.

    You can learn more about the background, benefits, and case studies of Jamstack in the book <a href="https://www.netlify.com/oreilly-jamstack/">Modern web development on the Jamstack</a>, (Biilmann & Hawksworth, O'Rreilly, 2019)
