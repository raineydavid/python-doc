GatherContent is a headless Content Operations Platform, helping thousands of organisations around the world to create quality content, in less time, and at scale. Our focus is on bridging the gap, and acting as the glue between development teams and content creators.

## Getting started with GatherContent as a headless CMS

You can visit our [headless CMS example](https://github.com/gathercontent/headless-cms-example), view our [Gatsby starter project](https://github.com/gathercontent/gatsby-starter-gathercontent) or view our [API documentation](https://docs.gathercontent.com) to get started with GatherContent

## Content delivery, without the baggage
Our integrations, API and headless capabilities give development teams absolute flexibility when it comes to publishing.

## Real-time collaborative editing
Create content collaboratively with tools youâ€™re used to. Your team will feel right at home.

## Structured templates and components
Structure content to save time and ensure consistency. Guidelines and instructions keep your content, and team focused.

## Customisable workflow

Set content workflows to ensure your content gets seen by the right people, at the right time, every time.

## A hub for content operations

Thousands of pieces of content to sort through? No problem. Organise, search, and manage content tasks with ease.
