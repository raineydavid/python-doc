## KeystoneJS: The programmable open source CMS for developers

[Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/) is the open source programmable backend that allows you to create a highly customised CMS and API in minutes.

It enables a way of building backend solutions that is productive, collaborative, and fun. With Keystone you can start fast and ship at speed without sacrificing your long view.

**More than a backend framework, and more than a Headless CMS. Keystone is a platform for next-gen development workflows and evolution.**

\
&nbsp;

- Powerful CRUD scaffolding
- Evolve with bespoke logic for your app
- Integrate microservices & external APIs

### 4. Deploy anywhere

Keystone is open source. Deploy it to managed services like Digital Ocean, Heroku, and Render, or your own custom infrastructure. The source of truth is your codebase, so Keystone fits naturally into your git-based development workflow, and you can use all the CI & Automation tooling you already know.
