## Tina is not a CMS

Tina is a **lightweight but powerful toolkit** for creating a content editing interface with JavaScript components. Tina surfaces superpowers for developers to create an intuitive UI for real-time content editing, built directly into their website.

To see Tina in action just go to [tinacms.org](https://tinacms.org) and click "Edit this Site"!

## The Next Generation of Content Management

Tina is optimized for next-gen Jamstack tools. It is written in JavaScript and easily adapted to multiple different frameworks.

Tina currently supports React-based frameworks, including:

- Next.js
- Gatsby
- Create-React-App
